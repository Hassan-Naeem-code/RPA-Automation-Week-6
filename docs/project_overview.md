# Project Overview

## Objective
Automate the retrieval, merging, transformation, and storage of environmental data for EcoAnalytics Solutions, replacing manual analyst workflows.

## Approach
- Fetch climate/sustainability metrics from an external API (or simulate if unavailable)
- Load tabular data from a local database or file
- Join, clean, and transform data
- Calculate KPIs (e.g., average air quality, emissions trends)
- Save enriched output for analysis

## Expected Outputs
- Final enriched dataset (Parquet or database)
- Workflow diagram
- Slide deck and demo video

## Data Sourcing
If live data is unavailable, synthetic data will be generated using Python and Faker.

## References
APA citations will be added for any referenced APIs, blogs, or research articles.
